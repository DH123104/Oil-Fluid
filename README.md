# Oil-Fluid
 Everything in Oil Fluid is made out of small spheres called particles. 
 Particles can interact with each other, affect and be affected by other objects trough the the use of constraints. 
 All oil fluid assets use the same physics framework and share the same architectural design. 
 Most of the information you'll find in this manual applies to all oil fluid assets, and there's specific sections that focus on each individual asset.
